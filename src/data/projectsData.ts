    descriptionLong: 'An LMS project designed to provide training modules for young apprentices in dental practices. Built in Vue, the platform consists of a series of interactive courses with images and information about dental practices, followed by quizzes in various formats. As one of my first professional Vue projects, I learned the framework’s basics by implementing features such as form validation for quiz answers and developing new modules for additional courses. I also integrated a PDF viewer.',

    descriptionLong: 'Eqwin is a mobile sports betting application for horse racing. During my internship, I had the opportunity to develop the back office from scratch. This dashboard retrieved data from Eqwin’s database, for which I wrote complex GraphQL queries to fetch necessary balances for admins and daily as well as total transactions. I presented this data as cards and charts. The back office also allowed administrators to put the mobile app into maintenance mode for updates. In this project, I gained experience in building dashboards with Vue and presenting data visually, while focusing on UI design.',

    colorTheme: 'red',
    descriptionLong: 'This is undoubtedly the most significant and impactful project I have worked on to date. My company received a contract from the ESIEA school to create a new student enrollment form. The form served as a comprehensive process for collecting student information (name, address, place of birth, etc.), official documents (such as diplomas and visas), details of financial guardians, and enabled payment of tuition fees and semesters. The ERP system was developed to gather this information and present it in tables and side panels, allowing ESIEA administrators to manage student records, enrollment campaigns, and internships. I also developed a mobile web application for internship requests at ESIEA. Throughout this project, I professionalized my development practices with strict code reviews, Typescript, ESLint, and more. I handled database modeling, wrote numerous GraphQL queries, worked on UX/UI, and developed backend routes to manage external services (document generation, email sending, payments). I made significant progress in my front-end implementations and deepened my mastery of Vue 3’s composition API.',

    descriptionLong: 'A 3D web video game developed during my 4th semester at ESIEA. This was my first project using Vue, and I also created the backend in JavaScript. We used Babylon.js to manage the 3D aspects of the game. The game consists of several mini-games that we often play at parties with friends (mainly card and dice games). We developed it during the COVID-19 lockdown to play with friends remotely since we couldn’t meet in person. I worked on 3D modeling, creating scenes, coding the game logic for the card games, and implementing front-end animations.',

    descriptionLong: 'The Walking Nerds is a fully 3D-rendered website. While I didn’t directly create 3D content, I performed multiple maintenance tasks during my internship. This allowed me to familiarize myself with the ecosystem and technologies used by the company, giving me valuable exposure to their workflow and tools.',

This project idea came during my 5th semester at ESIEA. We developed the frontend using React and the backend with Java (Spring Boot). I handled data processing algorithms by interacting with external APIs to format the data for the frontend and also developed several user interfaces in React.',

    descriptionLong: 'MEUPORG was my very first programming project at ESIEA, a mini-RPG built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the time, I had no experience with front-end frameworks, so this project was instrumental in helping me learn the basics of coding, especially JavaScript. I worked on creating the game map, writing combat scripts, and focused heavily on the project’s CSS to enhance its presentation.',
